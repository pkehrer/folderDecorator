# Folder Decorator
Ever wish your media folder had cool icons that showed the show/movie/album they contained?  No?? Then leave! 
This is a simple (windows only, sorry) app that you can point at a directory of media folders and it will
automatically search for the show/movie/album name based on the folder name and set the windows icon
to a cool little picture of the thing.  Try it out.
